\title{plots of spatial matrix population model projections}
\usage{
spmm.plot(
  projections,
  ylabs = NA,
  xlabs = NA,
  stage_names = NA,
  patch_names = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{projections}{A `matrix` with `nrow` n_stages Ã— n_patches and `ncol` of
n_timesteps (see `spmm.project` for more detail). If prerequisite steps,
i.e., `vec.perm`, `blk.diag`, `spmm.project.matrix`, and `spmm.project`, have been
specified correctly and correspond to structure of `n` (and expectations).}

\item{ylabs}{Y-axis label for plots.}

\item{xlabs}{X-axis label for plots.}

\item{stage_names}{Names of stages, ages, classes, etc.}

\item{patch_names}{Names of patches, units, pools, etc.}
}
\description{
Produces plots of deterministic future population sizes of stages s in
patches p. Depending on structure of `n`, plot frames represent patches or
stages and lines the opposite.
}
\note{
As with `spmm.project` ensure that the structural types of population vector
`n` and projection matrix `A` are the same. Otherwise, projections may produce
incorrect values!
