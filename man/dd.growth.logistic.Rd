\title{Density dependent logistic growth}
\usage{
dd.growth.logistic(N, B, K, beta = 0, theta = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Numeric vector. Abundance or biomass at time *t* for each stage or group.}

\item{B}{Numeric vector. Baseline or average per capita fecundity rates 
for each stage. Typically, only mature stages are nonzero.}

\item{K}{Numeric scalar. Carrying capacity, representing max abundance or biomass 
in the population, beyond which fecundity begins to decline.}

\item{beta}{Numeric scalar. Density feedback strength. 
\code{beta = 0} implies no density dependence. 
\code{beta > 0} enables enhanced reproduction at low density.}

\item{theta}{Numeric scalar. Shape parameter controlling the steepness of the 
response. \code{theta = 1} is standard logistic; \code{theta > 1} produces 
stronger decline at high density.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of modified per capita fecundity rates (same length as \code{N}), 
adjusted for density dependence.
}
\description{
Adjusts per capita fecundity based on current total population size at *t*
relative to carrying capacity using a theta-logistic-like formulation. 
Allows enhancement at low density and compensation at high density.
}
\note{
This theta-logistic formulation allows low-density enhancement (if \code{beta > 0}), 
mimicking undercompensatory or compensatory responses.
