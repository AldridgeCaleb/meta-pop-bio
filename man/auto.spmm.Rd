\description{
This function automates construction and analysis of a spatial 
population matrix model, from construction of the vec-permutation matrix to
plotting. THe user provides a `path` and `filename` for a spmm formatted
Excel Workbook (xlsx). 

Future plans include a "report" option that would include an RMarkdown (.Rmd)
and Word Document (.docx) as outputs. Additionally, I am exploring the ability
to "update" a spmm as a convenience function.
}
\note{
Workbook should follow template found in extdata. Objects can be 
assigned from the list using the unpacking / destructuring assignment "%<-%" 
from the zeallot package. (metapopbio currently lists zeallot as a dependency).
