# metapopbio: Construction and Analysis of Metapopulation Models
## Pacage Description
The [`metapopbio`](https://github.com/AldridgeCaleb/meta-pop-bio) package is inspired by and complements the fuctionalities of the [`popbio`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/popbio/index.html) package. Users can construct and analyze projection matrix models for metapopulations classified by age or stage and located in distinct patches.

The functionality to date is largely based on Hunter and Caswell (2005) to construct and analyze spatial matrix population models using the vec-permutation matrix. This model extends the Leslie matrix (Leslie 1945) to include dispersal rates between patches. An analogous approach was taken by Lebreton (1996) and called the "renewal equation approach."

## Installation
```r
install.packages(devtools)
devtools::install_github("AldridgeCaleb/meta-pop-bio")
library(metapopbio)
```

## Usage (placeholder)

## Support
Please report issues or bugs to https://github.com/AldridgeCaleb/meta-pop-bio/issues or email caleb.a.aldridge at gmail.com

## Roadmap
Current plans include support for classic metapopulation models of Gotelli (1991; 2008) *and others* (e.g., mainland--island model, internal colonization, and rescue effect) and hyperstate matrix models (Roth and Caswell 2016). Additionally, Hanski's (1994) incidence function and a metapopulation version of the **S**usceptible--**I**nfected--**R**ecovered model (SIR model) are also being considered. Other suggestions can be submitted in email to caleb.a.aldridge@gmail.com or as an issue on the package's GitHub repository (https://github.com/AldridgeCaleb/meta-pop-bio/issues).
