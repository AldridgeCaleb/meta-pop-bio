# metapopbio: Construction and Analysis of Metapopulation Models
## Pacage Description
`metapopbio` is an R package inspired by [`popbio`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/popbio/index.html) to construct and analyze projection matrix models of metapopulations classified by age or stage and location.

## Visuals (placeholder)
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation (placeholder)
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage (placeholder)
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support (placeholder)
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap (placeholder)
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
