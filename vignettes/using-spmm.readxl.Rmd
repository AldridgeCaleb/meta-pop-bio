The `spmm.readxl` function is a convenience function for reading in metadata and metapopulation matrices from an `.xlsx` file. A [template](man/spmm-template.xlsm) and an [example](man/spmm-example.xlsm) are provided. The example workbook is used to illustrate the `spmm.readxl` functionality below.

The first sheet of the workbook has cells for the user to input metadata. The first five peices of information regard the number of stages (`n_stages`), the number of patches (`n_patches`), how projections should be grouped (`group_by`; either by stages or patches), the order of life history functions (`lh_order`; either movement then demographic processes or vice versa), and the number of time steps to project into the future (`n_timesteps`). Following the peregrine falcon example as in the "Getting started..." vignette, the first sheet looks liek this:
